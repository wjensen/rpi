  // This function has one input parameter, the analog pin number
  // to read. You might notice that this function does not have
  // "void" in front of it; this is because it returns a floating-
  // point value, which is the true voltage on that pin (0 to 5V).
  
  // You can write your own functions that take in parameters
  // and return values. Here's how:
  
    // To take in parameters, put their type and name in the
    // parenthesis after the function name (see above). You can
    // have multiple parameters, separated with commas.
    
    // To return a value, put the type BEFORE the function name
    // (see "float", above), and use a return() statement in your code
    // to actually return the value (see below).
  
    // If you don't need to get any parameters, you can just put
    // "()" after the function name.
  
    // If you don't need to return a value, just write "void" before
    // the function name.

  // Here's the return statement for this function. We're doing
  // all the math we need to do within this statement:
  
  return (analogRead(pin) * 0.004882814);
  
  // This equation converts the 0 to 1023 value that analogRead()
  // returns, into a 0.0 to 5.0 value that is the true voltage
  // being read at that pin.
